# Roadmap

`KDDockWidgets` is by now a very mature product.<br>
Future development will be focused on finishing the `Flutter` frontend and improving `Wayland` support.<br>
`QtQuick` API will also mature, as users give feedback.<br>
There's nothing planned for `QtWidgets`, but feature requests and bug reports will be honoured for the foreseeable future.
